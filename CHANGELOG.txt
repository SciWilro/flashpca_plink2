Version 1.1.2
12-Aug-2014
* Updated this file

Version 1.1.0
12-Aug-2014

* Static binary compiled with gcc -march=core2
* Fixed bug in saving of mean + sd for each SNP (--meansd option)

Version 1.0.0
21-May-2014
* Makefile now looks for Eigen and Boost in /usr/local, by default
* flashpca now computes proportion of variance explained by each eigenvector
* Experimental support for kernel PCA
